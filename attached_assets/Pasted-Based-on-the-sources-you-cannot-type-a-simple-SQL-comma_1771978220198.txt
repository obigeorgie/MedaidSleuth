Based on the sources, you cannot type a simple SQL command into BigQuery to "pull" a file directly from an external government website. BigQuery requires the data to be in **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** first.

Here is the **comprehensive prompt** you can paste into an AI coding assistant (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Replit AI) to generate the **Python ETL script** that automates this process.

### **The Prompt to Generate the Solution**

> "Write a robust Python script to create an ETL pipeline for the HHS 'Medicaid Provider Spending' dataset (approx. 10.3 GB).
>
> **Requirements:**
> 1.  **Extract:** Download the dataset from `https://opendata.hhs.gov/datasets/medicaid-provider-spending/` (handle large file streaming to avoid memory errors).
> 2.  **Load to GCS:** Upload the file directly to a Google Cloud Storage bucket named `medicaid-raw-data`.
> 3.  **Load to BigQuery:** Use the `BigQueryClient` to load the data from GCS into a table named `medicaid_provider_spending`.
> 4.  **Configuration:** Enable `autodetect=True` for schema inference and set `source_format` to CSV (or Parquet if detected).
> 5.  **Schema:** Ensure the script anticipates key columns described in the dataset documentation: `provider_id` (NPI), `procedure_code`, `state_code`, `total_paid`, and `month`.
> 6.  **Error Handling:** Include retry logic for the 10GB download."

### **What This Will Build (The Architecture)**

The prompt above will generate a script that follows the architecture recommended in **Source ("Ingest Data: Script an ETL pipeline")** and **Source ("Big Data Handling")**.

Here is the exact SQL command the script will likely execute to perform the final load (which you can also run manually if you upload the file to GCS yourself):

```sql
LOAD DATA OVERWRITE `your_project_id.medicaid_data.claims`
FROM FILES (
  format = 'CSV',
  uris = ['gs://medicaid-raw-data/medicaid_provider_spending.csv'],
  skip_leading_rows = 1,
  null_marker = '',
  -- Source and detail these specific fields
  schema_update_options = ['ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION']
);
```

### **Why this approach?**
1.  **Size Constraints:** Source notes the file is **10.32 GB**. Browsers and simple scripts will crash trying to upload this directly to BigQuery. Google Cloud Storage acts as the necessary staging area.
2.  **Cost Efficiency:** Source mentions storing and querying this data in BigQuery costs roughly **$0.02/GB**, making it a highly economical way to host the full 227 million rows for your app.
3.  **Automation:** Source suggests automating "refreshes" as HHS releases new data. This script serves as the foundation for a cron job that keeps your app live with the latest "DOGE" transparency data.
